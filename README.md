## Introduction

The Adamik application is a boilerplate implementation of the main Adamik API endpoints. It serves as a starting point for developers looking to integrate with the Adamik API, providing essential functionalities and example usages of the API.

### Key Features
- **Multi-Signer Support**: Seamlessly switch between different signing providers (Sodot MPC, IoFinnet)
- **Multi-Chain Portfolio Management**: Track and manage assets across 50+ blockchain networks
- **Staking Operations**: Stake, unstake, and claim rewards across supported chains
- **Real-time Balance Updates**: Automatic UI refresh after transactions without page reloads
- **Developer-Friendly**: Clean architecture with signer-agnostic components

As a truly open-source project licensed under the MIT License, Adamik encourages community contributions and collaboration.

## Getting Started

The Adamik Application is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your development machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/adamik-app.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   cd adamik-app
   pnpm install
   ```

3. [Get your API key](https://dashboard.adamik.io/) if you don't already have one and set it in a file named `.env.local` at the root of the project.

   You will also need a Mobula API key to retrieve the prices, logos and tickers of assets.

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ADAMIK_API_TEST_URL="https://api.adamik.io/api"
   ADAMIK_API_KEY="<your Adamik API key>"
   MOBULA_API_KEY="<your Mobula API key>"
   ```

   For multi-signer support, you can also configure:
   ```
   # Sodot MPC Configuration (optional)
   SODOT_VERTEX_URL_0="<vertex_url>"
   SODOT_VERTEX_API_KEY_0="<api_key>"
   
   # IoFinnet Configuration (optional)
   IOFINNET_BASE_URL="<base_url>"
   IOFINNET_CLIENT_ID="<client_id>"
   IOFINNET_CLIENT_SECRET="<client_secret>"
   IOFINNET_VAULT_ID="<vault_id>"
   ```

### Running the Development Server

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
